You are an expert Python/Flask full-stack developer.
Your job is to create a complete Flask web application using the following requirements. Follow the instructions carefully and generate the entire project structure, code, and files exactly as requested.

🚀 PROJECT PURPOSE

This project is part of a Final Year Project (FYP) called Sentellect, but this part does NOT include any AI integration.
You only need to build a fully functional dynamic Flask application using the static templates provided.

📂 SOURCE REPO (STATIC PAGES)

Use the static HTML/CSS/JS pages from this public GitHub repo:

https://github.com/NomanAli019/StudentStressPages


These contain 12th class Mathematics (Pakistan Board) chapter quizzes and pages.

📌 REQUIRED APPLICATION FEATURES

Build a complete end-to-end Flask web application with the following requirements:

✔ 1. Project Structure (Modular Approach)

Create this exact folder structure:

project/
│ app.py
│ config.py
│ requirements.txt
│
├── instance/
│     └── database.sqlite
│
├── app/
│    ├── _init_.py
│    ├── models.py
│    ├── routes/
│    │    ├── _init_.py
│    │    ├── auth.py
│    │    ├── quizzes.py
│    │    └── main.py
│    ├── static/
│    │    ├── css/
│    │    ├── js/
│    │    └── images/
│    └── templates/
│         ├── base.html
│         ├── login.html
│         ├── signup.html
│         ├── dashboard.html
│         ├── chapters.html
│         ├── quiz.html
│         └── all other files from the repo

✔ 2. Flask App Requirements

Use SQLite as the database.

Use SQLAlchemy ORM for all data models.

App must run using:

python app.py


Use Blueprints for routes.

Use Jinja2 templating.

✔ 3. User Authentication

Implement full login + signup + logout system:

email

username

password (hashed with werkzeug.security)

created_at timestamp

Routes:

/signup

/login

/logout

/dashboard

Restrict dashboard + quiz pages to logged-in users.

Use Flask-Login for session management.

✔ 4. Quiz / Chapters Data

Create a CSV file inside /app/data/ containing:

chapter_number, chapter_name, topic, quiz_file


Example:

1, Functions & Limits, Domain and Range, ch1-domain-range.html


App should read this CSV and display:

all chapters

all topics

each quiz page inside the templates folder

✔ 5. Integration of Static Pages

All HTML files from the GitHub repo should be placed in:

app/templates/
app/static/css/
app/static/js/
app/static/images/


Link them properly.

All quizzes must render dynamically using Flask routes:

/chapters

/chapter/<id>

/quiz/<quiz_file>

✔ 6. Dashboard Requirements

Dashboard must show:

Welcome message

Chapters

Progress placeholders (static for now)

Button to start quizzes

No AI features needed.

✔ 7. Clean Coding Standards

Modular architecture

Comments on important functions

Proper error handling

Use Bootstrap or existing CSS from repo

✔ 8. Deliverables

Generate:

✅ Complete folder structure
✅ All Python files
✅ All HTML templates (copied from repo)
✅ database models
✅ CSV topic data
✅ Full routing system
✅ Authentication system
✅ Run instructions
✅ requirements.txt
